The below process of changing the config file and changing / creating the admin account took around an two hours to do with much trial and error....

Process to generate admin password hash for Node red master login

	cd /usr/lib/node_modules/node-red/node_modules
	node -e "console.log(require('bcryptjs').hashSync(process.argv[1], 8));"  password hash want to generate goes here
	
Adding the Password hash to the config file via nano. This also includes some modifications to the defualt config file.

	Cd /home/pi/.node-red
    Sudo nano settings.js 
	
		      adminAuth: {
          type: "credentials",
          users: [{
              username: "admin",
              password: "$2a$08$zZWtXTja0fB1pzD4sHCMyOCMYz2Z6dNbM6tl8sJogENOMcxWV9DN.",           >>>>>>  THIS IS NOT THE REAL HASH!!!! <<<<<<<<
              permissions: "*"
          }]
      },

Additional config file changes to change the information storage path

	 userDir: '/home/pi/.node-red/',
	 nodesDir: '/home/pi/.node-red/nodes',

	 After config file changes are made reboot and test…..
	 
Back up initial configuration to flash drive before continuing further…
