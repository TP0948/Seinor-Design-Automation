# node-red-contrib-mqtt-broker
MQTT Broker server on Node-RED

Because this MQTT broker is implemented by Node.js, you can use MQTT-in and MQTT-out nodes without MQTT environment like Mosquitto.

## Flows
Once you just put this node on Node-RED and hit deploy button, MQTT Broker will run on your Node-RED.

You can set "localhost" in MQTT-in and MQTT-out properties as follows.
